type your code inside the script.txt file and run the UDPL.exe to execute the code.


VARIABLES:
var a = hello world!;
var a = 123;
var a = input;
var a = true;
var a = false;
var a = a;
var a = [listName:0]
list a = yello,mello,hello;

LOGIC:
if(a=1){#}
while(a=1){#}
ifelse(a=1){#1}{#2}

LOOPS:
loop(5){#}
lstloop(i)(listName){print({i})}  - Loops through a list referencing each as 'i'

METHODS:
method(plus)(a,b){a+=b} - (methodName)(methodParams){methodBody}
call(a)(1,2) 

DISPLAY:
print(hello world)
print({VarName})
print([ListName:0])
print(var a = {a})
print(list lst value at index 0 = [lst:0])

INCREMENT/DECREMENT:
a++
a--
a+=5 
a-=a
a*=a
a/=a

MATH:
calc(varName){1+1*3} - basic calculator, solves between '{}' and stores result in 'varName'

OTHER:
wait(miliseconds)
clear; - Clears the console screen.
join(leftVar,rightVar) - joins left and right variables or and stores to left.
input - a keyword used to gather data from a users input.
console - enables the user to type code inside the console screen.
goto(fileName)(Line)
boolswap(VarName) - swaps a bool value from true -> false and false -> true.
slice(VarName)(SkipAmount) - 'skips characters' for given amount, negative starts from the end positive from the begining.
char(VarName)(Index) - gets the character from a value at given index.


FILES:
runfile(Filename) - runs a txt file next to UDPL.exe.
delfile(Filename)
appendfile(Filename){data} - appends all between '{}' to Filename also (@ = newline)
