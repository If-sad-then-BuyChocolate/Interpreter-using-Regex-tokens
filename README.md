# Interpreter-using-Regex-tokens
I know it says lexer, its not a lexer at all sorry, was a miss type ;)

This program is a simple way of making a interpreter using tokens generated from a regex pattern.

It loops through each token to try and recognize specific words that can be a reference to a command.

There are other functions that allow you to:
-skip until a given token, 
-retrieve data until a given token, 
-retrieve data between 2 given characters that can also handle nested in-betweens.
-replace variables references with its values as well as list values.
